# CMS Detection PHP

This project is a simple **CMS Detection Tool** written in PHP. It allows users to detect the Content Management System (CMS) used by a website, such as WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento, or PrestaShop. The detection is based on unique patterns in the website's structure, including specific paths, files, and content associated with different CMS platforms.

2. Open the `detectCMS.php` file and replace the `$url` variable with the website URL you want to check.
   
3. Run the script on a server with PHP support:
